## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

During my studies, I worked on several projects that allowed me to apply my Java skills and gain practical experience. One of my notable projects involved developing a web application using Spring Boot and integrating it with a MySQL database. I successfully implemented features such as user authentication, CRUD operations, and RESTful API endpoints.
I am passionate about staying updated with advancements in the Java ecosystem and continuously learning new technologies. I enjoy challenging myself and exploring innovative solutions to complex problems.

This repository contains projects and code examples showcasing my skills and experience as a Java developer. Here, you will find a collection of Java applications, algorithms, and frameworks that I have worked on.

In addition to complete projects, you will find a variety of code examples that demonstrate my expertise in various aspects of Java development, including:

- Data structures and algorithms implementation
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Database operations using JDBC and SQL
- Error handling and exception management
- Unit testing using JUnit
