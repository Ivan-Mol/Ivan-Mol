Hi everyone! During my studies, I worked on several projects that allowed me to apply my Java skills and gain practical experience. One of my notable projects involved developing a web application using Spring Boot and integrating it with a MySQL database. I successfully implemented features such as user authentication, CRUD operations, and RESTful API endpoints.
I am passionate about staying updated with advancements in the Java ecosystem and continuously learning new technologies. I enjoy challenging myself and exploring innovative solutions to complex problems.

This repository contains projects and code examples showcasing my skills and experience as a Java developer. Here, you will find a collection of Java applications, algorithms, and frameworks that I have worked on.

Hobbies are an essential part of our lives, providing an outlet for creativity and personal expression. My favorite hobbies are music(metal, ambient), photography, art and design.
One of my favorite hobbies is Digital Art, where I enjoy expressing my creativity and experimenting with various design techniques. 
Another hobby of mine is traveling. I have been fortunate enough to explore 20 countries so far, immersing myself in different cultures, cuisines, and landscapes.
When I'm not designing or exploring the world, you can often find me at metal gigs. I'm a passionate fan of metal music, and attending live concerts gives me an electrifying rush of energy.
To balance out my creative and cultural pursuits, I also prioritize my health and fitness. I regularly hit the gym to stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle. 
Overall, these hobbies fulfill different aspects of my life. They allow me to express my creativity, satisfy my sense of wanderlust, indulge in my musical preferences, and stay physically and mentally fit. Engaging in these activities brings me happiness and a sense of personal growth.
